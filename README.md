# About our lab
Our lab develops microtechnology tools to observe in vivo neuronal and behavioral responses to precise stimulation. We study the molecular and genetic basis of neural excitability, how it directs information flow within neural circuits, and its role in neuropsychiatric disorders.

On this site you will find documentation for our publically released software and hardware setups.  The navigation panel on the left will guide you through the software and hardware that go into our experimental techniques.  Thanks for visiting!
