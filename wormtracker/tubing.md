# Microfluidic tubing connections
There are many ways to interface from the macroscale (tubing, reservoirs, etc) to a microfluidic device.  Commonly, this involves flexible tubing and rigid hollow pins that insert into the PDMS device.

We typically use the following materials:

* Pins: New England Small Tube, P/N: NE-1027-12, 0.042OD x 0.027ID x 0.500long
* Tubing: Tygon S-54-HL 0.020" ID, 0.020" wall, Fisher cat# 1417015B
* Punch: Acuderm 1mm dermal punch

Note that the ID of the tubing is less than that of the pin, so I heat the tubing up (brief sweep above a flame until soft), open with fine forceps, and wiggle in the pin. As it cools it shrinks and grabs tightly on the pin. Best is to insert ~1/3 of the pin.
