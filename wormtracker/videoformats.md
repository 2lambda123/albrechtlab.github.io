# Video formats
Tracking code currently works with videos that are in .AVI format and compressed with Indeo Video 5 (or uncompressed).  Videos should be 24-bit color depth.

If your video is in another format, many free video converters are available online.  One that I use regularly is VideoMach.  Note that in this program, the video format (or wrapper), in this case .AVI, is chosen when selecting a filename for the converted video.  The compression codec (Indeo Video 5, or IV50) is selected separately under the video tab.
